I attended DevOps Days India conference on 4th and 5th Nov 2016. Details on devops days India can be found [here](http://devopsdaysindia.org/index.html#header). The event was filled with discussions around multiple devops aspects. Kubernetes was the hottest topic among all. Speakers talked about ChatOps, security issues in current containerised infrastructure, Docker, OpenShift, Rancher, Terraform, Chef, Hadoop Clusters, Monitoring and Alerting solutions.
